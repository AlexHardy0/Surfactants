2D Simulation of Binary-Fluid-Surfactant System

This repository contains the code developed as part of my PhD work at The Open University in the Mathematics and Statistics Department. The project involves simulating a 2D fluid-surfactant system using a combination of numerical methods.

Methods Used:

Finite Difference Method: Applied to model the phase field of the fluid. Used to solve the Langevin equation for particle dynamics.

Fourier Spectral Method: Employed to solve the velocity field of the fluid.


Installation

To run the simulation, you will need the following dependencies:

Python 3.10 NumPy Matplotlib
